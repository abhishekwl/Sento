# Sento
SenTo

Sentiment Analysis on text by performing data mining operations on huge amount of data by extracting tweets for a certain query and then performing sentiment analysis with the help of a data corpus on every tweet to know how biased people are to a certain topic on Twitter.

Usage:
Open up a terminal.
1) Fork the repo on your local machine. (Or just download the Zip)
2) Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed on your device (Won't work on interpreters of version >=3 as of now)
3) Make sure you have pip installed on your device (Check by keying in pip -V)
4) Use a virtualenv (Preferred) and/or type 'python setup.py'. This should set the wheels in motion.
5) After injecting the required dependencies and data corpus once (automatically happens once you run setup.py), you don't have to run setup.py again, just start off by typing 'python mainPY.pyc'

Cheers :)
